## 3. Project
Dom √âqui-m√©diation is a website for a therapist who works with poneys and horses. She needed to have a simple website with some informations (the description of horses mediation, the population who can make this, a gallery with some pics, a contact form and the localisation).

I didn't have a mockup or a fixed design, just a visit card with the logo and a wallpaper. The client had no requirements, she left me free to do what i want. So here is my first website as a developer, AND as a UI/UX designer ü•≥ ! 

For this project i use:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React-burger-menu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-burger-menu) for the beautiful mobile menu.
- [React-hook-form](https://sass-lang.com/) to have a basic form with a good code organization.
- [React-toastify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-toastify) to have a beautiful modale to confirm the user he send a message.
- [Emailjs-com](https://www.emailjs.com/) to send the user message to the client mail.
- [Google-map-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-map-react) to have a localisation on the contact component.
- [Greensock](https://greensock.com/) to make some animations and transitions.
